# DönerIndex 🍖📊

An open-source project to create the most objective, comprehensive dataset of döner shops — starting with our city and expanding across the globe.

To catalog döner shops with 100% objective data: price, weight, dimensions, meat type, bread type, extras, location, and more.

## 📁 Folder Structure
- `data/` - Raw and cleaned CSVs
- `scripts/` - Data cleaning, analysis, and visualization scripts
- `images/` - Photos of döner and shops
- `docs/` - Documentation and methodology

## ✅ Features

- Easily extendable to other cities

## 🚀 Coming Soon
- Interactive map of döner spots
